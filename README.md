# WindowViewportTr
This was created as an exam project for my Introduction to Computer Graphics course. 
The task was to implement Window to Viewport transformation with the following criteria: 
- the canvas shows two rectangles, one strictly on one side of the dividing line, the other on the other side
- you place points on the left half plane with a mouse click which forms a polygon that needs to be clipped by the rectangle of the half plane
- the program constantly transforms it to the ViewPort side of the canvas.
