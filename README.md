# WindowViewportTr
This was created as an exam project for my Introduction to Computer Graphics course. 
The task was to implement Window to Viewport transformation with the following criteria: 
- the canvas shows two rectangles, representing the Window and the Videwport respectively, devided by a vertical line
- you place points on the left half plane with mouse clicks which form a polygon that needs to be clipped by the rectangle of the half plane
- the program constantly transforms it to the ViewPort side of the canvas.
